I am an experienced software developer with a solid foundation in microservice architecture and containerization, primarily using Go (GoLang). My expertise includes applying the twelve factors of app development, covering code guidelines, dependency management, configurability, service design, automation, integration management, containerization standards, testing, process engineering, error handling, and log tracing. I adhere to clean architecture principles, focusing on modularity, maintainability, and SOLID principles, within an Agile SDLC framework.

In my role, I contribute to driving effective teams through clear communication and collaboration. I assist in developing infrastructure and code, managing projects, and meeting requirements. To enhance efficiency, I use tracking software for optimizing self-awareness.

My development workflow emphasizes automation through git hooks, adhering to coding conventions, creating documentation, code generation, using conventional commit messages, linting, formatting, testing, vulnerability checking, and static and dynamic code analysis. I also follow container security best practices and prioritize reconfigurability and service provisioning, ensuring comprehensive code reviews. I prefer using docker-compose for development, running, and testing environments, with a focus on service health checks.

To ensure project timelines are met, I manage meetings strategically and define clear issue labels and statuses. My attention to detail supports the long-term success of projects.
